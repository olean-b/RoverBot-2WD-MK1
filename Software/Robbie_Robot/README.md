# Robbie_Robot
An mBlock extension for driving robots using the L9110S driver board

# Usage
The attach drive train block must be used first to initalise the drive train. This needs to be passed 4 pin numbers, one for each of the motor control pins.

Once this has been done, the forward, backward, turn left, and turn right blocks can be used. These blocks have a power parameter, which sets how much power the motors should have.
